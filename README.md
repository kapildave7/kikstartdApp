# kikstartdApp
The dapp is a Kickstarter-like project.  The user can deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum Rinkeby test network and let another user create a campaign (like each funding project on Kickstarter) for crowdfunding.  After the user created a campaign, the other users can choose to support the campaign.  The campaign raiser can make requests to buy something for finishing the campaigns, and the campaign supporters can decide whether to approve the request. backend is on solidity and the frontend is on react-react native using web3.
